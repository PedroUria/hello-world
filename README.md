# hello-world

Hi everybody! I don't care if you are a *person* or an *computer program*, you're welcome here :D

My name is Pedro Uria and I'm an aspiring **data scientist**. I'm currently enrolled in the **Master of Science in Data Science** at **GWU**, and this is my first time trying **GitHub**. 

Let's have some fun, alright!
